Hello there! I'm an aspiring software engineer and computer scientist. I study Computer Science and Mathematics at UNC-Chapel Hill.

My interests span Distributed Systems, Programming Languages, and Algorithms. I strive to developing performant, scalable and reliable systems.

In my free-time, I love working on algorithmic challenges through Leetcode, Codeforces, and compete in the elu00.github.io
