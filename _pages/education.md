🏆- Favorite class of the semester award

All the professors who've earned a 🏆:
* [Don Porter](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/)
* [Kevin Jeffay](https://jeffay.web.unc.edu/)
* [Leonard McMillan](http://www.csbio.unc.edu/mcmillan/index.py)
* [Samarjit Chakraborty](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~samarjit/)
* [Chuanshu Ji](https://stor.unc.edu/faculty-member/ji-chuanshu/)

## Spring 2024 
* Internship at Palantir

## Fall 2023
* *Programming Languages*: Learned SML, Prolog, and Lisp. Wrote a lambda supporting lisp interpreter in Java.
* 🏆*Operating Systems*: "Any problem in computer science can be solved by another layer of indirection"
* *Beyond Objects: Programming in the 21st Century*: Fast and broad trip across many different programming paradigms and models.
* *2D-Graphics*: Developed a performant 2-D graphics library in C++
* **Teaching assistant for Programming Intelligent Physical Systems (PIPS)**

## Spring 2023
* 🏆*Internet Services and Protocols*: Super challenging but learned a ton. Inspired [this](/systems/networking/2023/05/22/rucket.html) project!
* *Numerical Analysis*: Some numeric problems are well conditioned, some are not.
* *Machine Learning*: Linear regression will probably work but it also might not. [Final Paper](/assets//misc/COMP_562_Final_Project_Report.pdf)
* *Foundations of Software Engineering*: Wrote code with friends, made [this](https://team-d8-comp423-23s.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/)👍
* **Teaching Assistant for Files and Databases**: Repeated teaching makes for great understanding

## Fall 2022
* 🏆*Computer Organization*: I understand how sand can think and compilers can link 😎
* *Algorithms and Analysis*: Learned and proved [median of medians](https://austinrochford.com/posts/2013-10-28-median-of-medians.html) for true O(n) quick-select. (Don't use median of medians [irl](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66625693/quick-select-with-random-pick-index-or-with-median-of-medians))
* *Files and Databases*: Saving I/O operations \>\>> Saving Processor Cycles
* *Internship in Computer Science*: Worked at Cash App. Systems need to be fast and cost efficient when you have tens of millions of customers.

## Spring 2022
* *Foundations of Programming*: Learned a lot of design patterns
* *Systems Fundamentals*: Wrote code in C => Segmentation fault (core dumped)
* *Models of Languages and Computation*: Regex now makes sense. [Chompsky's hierarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=224plb3bCog)
* 🏆*Programming Intelligent Physical Systems*: Learned how to model and control continuous systems. Then again, but on a discrete processor 🖥️
* *English 105i*: Writing clearly matters a lot everywhere!

## Fall 2021 (First semester at UNC 🐏)
* 🏆*Probability*: Lots of PDFs, CDFs, and detours
* *Discrete Mathematics*: Pidgeons, bets, and all the sets
* *Muslim American Literature*: Writing papers and reading
* *Chinese Civilizations*: Writing papers and reading some more
* *Racket-sports*: 🏸


## High School

* *Calculus I, II, and III*: All it takes to figure out the future is how things change.
* *Linear Algebra*: A good Orthonormal basis can solve a lot of problems
* *Differential Equations*: Caught a few glimpses of the frequency domain
* [*Vex Robotics*](https://www.robotevents.com/teams/VRC/33011x): Doing things requires knowing what happened, what needs to happen, and how to make it happen. That's hard to do fast!⚡
* *Founding the Data Science Club*: ML, Optimization and Data Visualization is great but presenting it well is even better
