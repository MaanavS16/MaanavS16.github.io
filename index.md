Hello there! I'm an aspiring software engineer and computer scientist. I study [Computer Science](https://cs.unc.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.unc.edu/) as an undergraduate at UNC-Chapel Hill with an Accelerated Research Scholarship. 

My technical interests span Programming Languages, High Performance Computing, and Distributed Systems. I have extensive internship experience building performant, scalable, and reliable systems that have served hundreds of millions of customers and I'm always keen to make an impact. 

In my free-time, I enjoy solving algorithmic puzzles on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/MaanavS/), Codeforces, and Kattis. I also compete in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) for UNC. I've served as a teaching assistant for Files and Databases, and strive to condense complicated topics into managible and informative guides: both as an instructor and technical collaborator.

Feel free to read my blog for a glimpse at my work!
