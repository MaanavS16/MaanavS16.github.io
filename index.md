Hello there! I'm an aspiring software engineer and computer scientist. I study [Computer Science](https://cs.unc.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.unc.edu/) as an undergraduate at UNC-Chapel Hill with an Accelerated Research Scholarship. 

My technical interests span Programming Languages, High Performance Computing, and Distributed Systems. I love packing my schedule with challenging classes and working on projects. I've served as a teaching assistant for Files and Databases, and strive to condense complicated topics into managible and informative guides: both as an instructor and technical collaborator.

Professionally, I'm currently interning at [SIG](https://sig.com/) as a Software Engineer and I've previously worked at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/) on App Runner and [Cash App](https://block.xyz/) on Recommendation ML. I have extensive experience building performant, scalable, and reliable systems that have served hundreds of millions of customers and I'm always keen to make an impact!

In my free-time, I enjoy solving algorithmic puzzles on Leetcode, Codeforces, and Kattis and listening to podcasts (big fan of [Signals and Threads](https://signalsandthreads.com/) and [ADSP](https://adspthepodcast.com/about/)). I also compete in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) for UNC.

Feel free to read my [blog](/blog/) or [education](/education/) for a glimpse at my work!
